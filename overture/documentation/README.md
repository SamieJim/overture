# Overture Documentation

The files here are intended to be only things specific to the technical details Overture platform and its build system.  For general documentation about Overture, VDM, and so forth, go to the [Overture Language Board repository](http://github.com/overturetool/language).

There may yet be things that need to migrate out of here; this is a continuing task.
