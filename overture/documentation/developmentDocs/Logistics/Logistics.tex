\section{Maven}
Maven\footnote{\url{http://maven.apache.org/}} is a software tool for Java project management and build automation. It is similar in functionality to the Apache Ant tool, but is based on different concepts. Maven uses a construct known as a Project Object Model (POM) to describe the software project being built, its dependencies on other external modules and components, and the build order. It comes with pre-defined targets for performing certain well defined tasks such as compilation of code and its packaging \cite{Wikipedia}.
