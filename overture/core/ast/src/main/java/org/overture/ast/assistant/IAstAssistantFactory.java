/**
 * The {@link IAstAssistantFactory} defines the main interface for assistant factories. Assistants are responsible for
 * providing generic functionality that is required on multiple occasions and that (for various reasons) cannot be
 * implemented directly in the visitors. <br>
 * <br>
 * Factories are responsible for providing users with extensible access to the assistant functionality. Each module that
 * needs assistants should create a factory and access a visitor by calling factory.createXAssistant where X is the node
 * type that the functionality acts upon. <br>
 * <br>
 * All factories should subclass either this interface or one of its subclasses. These classes are in a straight
 * hierarchy chain as follows: {@link IAstAssistantFactory} <- ITypeCheckerAssistantFactory <- *PluginLevelFactory <br>
 * <br>
 * By following this inheritance chain, at every level a single factory can provide all assistants. Extensions should
 * hook into the hierarchy by subclassing their extension superclass, if one extist. Otherwise, subclass their Overture
 * counterpart.
