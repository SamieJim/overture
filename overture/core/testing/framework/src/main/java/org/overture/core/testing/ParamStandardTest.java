/**
 * Standard test in the new Overture test framework. This class runs testing on (correct) VDM sources and compares them
 * with stored result files. It is meant to be subclassed as a way to quickly create your own test suites.<br>
 * <br>
 * A comparison method for results must be provided. JSON-based serialization of results is fully automated and
 * deserialization is close to it.<br>
 * <br>
 * These testing are meant to be run as parameterized JUnit test and so any subclass must be annotated with
 * <code>@RunWith(Parameterized.class)</code>. <br>
 * <br>
 * This class also has a type parameter <code>R</code> that represents the output of the functionality under test. You
 * should create a specific <code>R</code> type for your functionality and write some kind of transformation between
 * your native output type and <code>R</code>.
