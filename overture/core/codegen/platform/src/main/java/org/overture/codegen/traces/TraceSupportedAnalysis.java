/**
 * This analysis determines if a named trace can be code generated. Code generation of traces currently does not support
 * call object statements which contain explicit field module names different from the name of the enclosing class.
 * Example: A quoted method call is only supported if the explicit module name is equal to that of the enclosing class.
 * Say A is a sub class of S and 'a' is an instance of A then a.A`op(); is allowed (although it is the same as a.op()).
 * However, a.S`op(); is not allowed. This is already reported as unsupported at the IR level so there is no need for
 * this analysis to detect this case. The super call statement is, however, not supported by the code generator when it
 * does appear in traces. Therefore, this analysis will detect this case.
