External Modules
---
This folder holds external dependencies. They are accessed via GitHub submodules.

To initialise the submodule (and checkout the relevant files) use `git
submodule update --init`. This should be done:

* after cloning the repository
* after switching branches that  change the submodule commit (`modified: docrepo (new commits)`) 

See https://github.com/overturetool/overture/wiki/Working-With-Examples for more.
